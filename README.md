Rap Lyrics Generation
Contributors: Grace Chai, Mo Ma, Patrick Bucher

This is a semester course project for Machine Learning class. Our group used nlp to create rap lyrics. We collected data from Genius API and trained different Neural Network models to 
generate lyrics.

The data includes 224 artists, 14,608 songs, 33,180 verses, 555,696 lines, and 24,861,710 words. 

Models include Word2Vec+LSTM, LSTM with Rhyme, and CNN. Word2Vec+LSTM was trained by half of the dataset due to the computational cost. 
LSTM with Rhyme only used Kanye West's song lyrics.
